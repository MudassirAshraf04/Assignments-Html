    <h1><strong>The Story in the Book</strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk,lying between the copies of Nature,New Scientist,and all the other<br>
       scientific journals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed copy of On The Road.It had been Molly's favourite book since collage,and the longer she<br>
       spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have<br> 
       nothing better to do</q>.Although many considered her pioneering work,unraveling the secrets of the llama <b>DNA</b>,to be an outstanding achievement,Molly<br>
       did think she had something better to do.</p>

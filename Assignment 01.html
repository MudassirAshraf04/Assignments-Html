    <p><center><q>A <b>Muslim</b> is obligated to pray five times a day: once before sunrise, at noon, in the afternoon, after sunset, and once at night. During prayer a <b>Muslim</b> focuses and <i><u>meditates</u></i><br>
       on God by reciting the <strong>Qur'an</strong> and engaging in zikr to strengthen the bond between Creator and creation, with the purpose of guiding the soul to truth. Such<br> 
       <em><abbr title ="مراقبہ">meditation</abbr></em> is intended to help maintain a feeling of spiritual peace, in the face of whatever challenges work, social or family life may present.</q></center></P>
